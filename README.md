# 🧠 Bayesian Network for Heart Failure Clinical Records

This project analyzes medical data related to heart failure and builds a **Bayesian Network** to support clinical decision-making and risk prediction. It combines data science techniques with probabilistic modeling to identify key health indicators and visualize dependencies between variables.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `BiseraAngelovska.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, variable selection, model structure, and interpretation.
- `water_potability.csv` – CSV dataset used for training and exploration.
- `heart_failure_model.xdsl` – GeNIe file representing the final Bayesian Network, built using SMILE/GeNIe.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze clinical features affecting heart failure.
- Select attributes using information value.
- Build and structure a **Bayesian Network** using GeNIe.
- Perform probability inference and sensitivity analysis.
- Provide visual and statistical explanation of outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GeNIe / SMILE (Bayesian Network modeling)
- CSV for data import

---

## 📌 Notes

- The GeNIe file (`.xdsl`) can be opened using the [GeNIe Modeler](https://www.bayesfusion.com/genie/).
- The project uses **static data**; live clinical integration is not implemented.
